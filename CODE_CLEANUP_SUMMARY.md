# Code Cleanup Summary

## Date: 2025-07-02

### Removed Unused Functions

1. **text-finder.js**
   - Removed `isBlockBoundary()` - was exported but never used anywhere

2. **dom-highlighter.js**
   - Removed `unwrapHighlight()` - unused, deletion is done inline
   - Removed `mergeAdjacentTextNodes()` - unused, code uses normalize() directly
   - Made `getTextNodesInRange()` private (removed export) - only used internally

### Fixed Multi-Container Selection Issue
- Removed the check that was preventing multi-container highlights
- The existing `wrapTextNodes()` function already handles multi-container selections properly
- Removed unused methods: `isMultiContainerSelection()` and `createMultiContainerHighlight()`

### Organized Test Files
Moved all test files from src/ to test/ directory:
- `test/highlighting/` - highlight engine tests
- `test/ui/` - UI component tests  
- `test/core/` - core functionality tests
- `test/restoration/` - restoration tests
- `test/store/` - Redux store tests

### Moved Test HTML Files
- Created `test-pages/` directory
- Moved all test-*.html files to keep root directory clean

### Current Architecture
The highlighting system is now clean and efficient:
- Event-driven communication between components
- No external library dependencies (Rangy removed)
- Multi-container selection support working
- All special characters (colons, etc.) handled correctly

### Test Results
- All edge case tests passing (33+ tests)
- Multi-container selection working
- Colon selection working
- List structure preservation confirmed
