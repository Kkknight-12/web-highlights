# Chrome Web Highlighter - Fixes Applied

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Compression Library Error
**Problem**: "Failed to load compression library" - popup.js was trying to load 'lz-string.min.js' which doesn't exist
**Solution**: Removed all compression-related code and simplified storage to use plain JSON

### 2. Empty Highlights in Popup
**Problem**: Highlights weren't showing in the popup window
**Solution**: Fixed storage format mismatch - both content.js and popup.js now use the same flat array structure

### 3. DOM Manipulation Errors
**Problem**: Errors like "highlightButtonContainer.style.left" when extension context was invalid
**Solution**: Added defensive try-catch blocks and orphaned state checks before DOM manipulation

### 4. Extension Context Invalidated Errors
**Problem**: Multiple "Extension context invalidated" errors in console
**Solution**: 
- Added comprehensive error suppression
- Added isOrphaned checks before all Chrome API calls
- Implemented graceful cleanup when context is invalid

## Changes Made

### popup.js
- Removed LZString compression dependency
- Simplified storage to use flat array of highlights
- Fixed loadHighlights() to filter by current URL
- Fixed deleteHighlight() and clearAllHighlights() to work with flat array

### content.js
- Added try-catch blocks to showHighlightButton() and hideHighlightButton()
- Added isOrphaned checks to event handlers
- Added protection for chrome:// URLs
- Improved error handling in DOM manipulation functions

### manifest.json
- Added exclude_matches to prevent running on Chrome extension pages

## Testing Instructions

1. Reload the extension in chrome://extensions
2. Go to any webpage (not chrome://)
3. Select some text - the highlight button should appear
4. Click to highlight - the text should turn yellow
5. Open the extension popup - highlights should be visible
6. Try deleting a highlight - it should work
7. Check console - no more "Extension context invalidated" errors

## What Was NOT Changed

- Core highlighting functionality remains the same
- Storage key ('highlights') remains the same
- Highlight data structure remains the same
- UI/UX remains unchanged

The fixes focus on stability and error handling without changing the user experience.
