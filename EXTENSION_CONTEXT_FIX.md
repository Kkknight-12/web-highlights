# Extension Context Invalidated - Fix Summary

## Problem
The Chrome extension was throwing "Extension context invalidated" errors when:
1. The extension was reloaded during development
2. Chrome updated the extension
3. Content scripts tried to access Chrome APIs after the extension context became invalid

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Early Chrome Runtime Check
```javascript
// Early exit if no chrome runtime
if (typeof chrome === 'undefined' || !chrome.runtime) {
    console.log('Chrome Web Highlighter: Chrome runtime not available');
    return;
}
```

### 2. Comprehensive Context Validation
```javascript
function isExtensionContextValid() {
    try {
        return !!(chrome && chrome.runtime && chrome.runtime.id);
    } catch (e) {
        return false;
    }
}
```

### 3. Error Suppression Strategy
- All Chrome API calls are wrapped in try-catch blocks
- Context invalidation errors are silently handled
- Only non-context errors are logged to console

### 4. Periodic Context Checking
```javascript
let contextCheckInterval = setInterval(() => {
    if (!isExtensionContextValid()) {
        isOrphaned = true;
        clearInterval(contextCheckInterval);
        cleanup();
    }
}, 5000);
```

### 5. Graceful Cleanup
When context is invalidated:
- All event listeners are removed
- UI elements are cleaned up
- Intervals/timeouts are cleared
- No more Chrome API calls are made

## Key Changes Made

1. **content.js**:
   - Added early runtime check
   - Enhanced error handling in all async functions
   - Suppressed context invalidation error logging
   - Added double-checks before Chrome API access
   - Implemented cleanup on context invalidation

2. **background.js**:
   - Added try-catch to message handlers
   - Added null checks for sender.tab
   - Suppressed context errors

## Testing
To test the fix:
1. Load the extension in Chrome
2. Open a webpage and create some highlights
3. Go to chrome://extensions and reload the extension
4. The errors should no longer appear in the console
5. The old content script will gracefully shut down

## Why This Happens
- Chrome extensions run in an isolated context
- When an extension updates/reloads, existing content scripts become "orphaned"
- These orphaned scripts can't communicate with the extension anymore
- Any Chrome API call from an orphaned script throws this error

## Best Practices Applied
1. Always check `chrome.runtime?.id` before API calls
2. Wrap all Chrome API operations in try-catch
3. Implement cleanup routines for orphaned scripts
4. Use periodic checks to detect context invalidation
5. Fail silently on context errors (they're expected)
