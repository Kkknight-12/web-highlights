# Chrome Web Highlighter - Final Context Error Fix

## Problem
Even after implementing context validation checks, "Extension context invalidated" errors were still appearing in the console.

## Root Cause
The error was coming from line 873 in content.js:
```javascript
console.warn('Error restoring highlight:', e);
```

This console.warn was inside the forEach loop in loadHighlights() and was logging ALL errors without checking if they were context-related.

## Solution
Added error type checking before logging:
```javascript
} catch (e) {
    // Only log non-context errors
    if (!e.message?.includes('Extension context invalidated') && 
        !e.message?.includes('Cannot access a chrome')) {
        console.warn('Error restoring highlight:', e);
    }
}
```

## Key Learning
When suppressing context errors, EVERY console.log/warn/error statement must check the error type first. Missing even one will cause errors to appear.

## Checklist for Future Error Handling
- [ ] Check error type BEFORE any console statement
- [ ] Use consistent error checking pattern across all catch blocks
- [ ] Search for all console.error/warn/log statements in catch blocks
- [ ] Test by reloading extension and checking console
