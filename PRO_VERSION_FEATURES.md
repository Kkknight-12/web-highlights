## üé® UI Library Considerations

### Discussion Point: Low-Level UI Libraries
We need to discuss whether to integrate a low-level UI library to handle complex UI interactions more robustly. Current issues like dropdown z-index stacking contexts could be better handled with dedicated libraries.

**Potential Options:**
1. **Alpine.js** (15KB) - Minimal framework, perfect with Tailwind CSS
2. **Floating UI** (6KB) - Specialized for positioning (dropdowns, tooltips)
3. **Tippy.js** (17KB) - Ready-made tooltips and dropdowns
4. **Web Components** (Shoelace, Lit) - Native browser components
5. **Headless UI alternatives** - Unstyled, accessible components

**Benefits:**
- Solve complex positioning issues (z-index, viewport boundaries)
- Consistent behavior across browsers
- Accessibility built-in (ARIA, keyboard navigation)
- Reduced custom code maintenance
- Better animation and transition support

**Considerations:**
- Additional bundle size (6-17KB typically)
- Learning curve for library APIs
- Dependency management
- Chrome extension size limits

**Recommendation:** Consider Alpine.js for PRO version features that require complex UI interactions, while keeping the free version lightweight with vanilla JS.
