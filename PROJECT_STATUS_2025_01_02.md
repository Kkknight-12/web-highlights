# Chrome Web Highlighter - Project Status (January 2, 2025)

## Project Overview
A Chrome extension that allows users to highlight text on any webpage. Highlights are saved locally and persist across page reloads.

**Tech Stack**: Vanilla JS, Chrome Extension Manifest V3, Redux Toolkit, Vite

## Recent Major Fixes

### 1. Cross-Element Highlight Restoration (SOLVED)
**Problem**: When selecting text across multiple list items, the extension created one big highlight with newlines that couldn't be restored after page reload.

**Solution**: Detect cross-element selections and create separate highlights for each block element (li, p, div). Each element gets its own highlight ID and storage entry.

**Technical Implementation**:
- Added `createMultipleHighlights()` method in highlight-engine.js
- Each list item now gets its own highlight object
- Proper container detection for list-specific restoration

### 2. Text Restoration Bug for Split Nodes (SOLVED)
**Problem**: Text like "Text: Select" was being restored as just "Text: Sel" when the browser split it across multiple text nodes.

**Root Cause**: Calculation error in `findTextInContainer()` when collecting text from multiple nodes.

**Fix**: Corrected the math to properly track remaining characters:
```javascript
// Fixed calculation
const stillNeeded = originalTextLength - collectedLength
const takeLength = Math.min(stillNeeded, nodeText.length)
```

### 3. Architecture Refactoring (COMPLETED)
**From**: Mixed event-driven + Redux architecture causing circular dependencies
**To**: Clean Redux-only state management
**Result**: Simpler, more maintainable code without the EventBus complexity

## Current Architecture

```

## Testing Migration
**Old**: Jest unit tests with mocked DOM
**New**: Playwright E2E tests with real Chrome browser
**Why**: Catches real browser issues (text node splitting, DOM quirks) that unit tests miss

## Future Work

### 1. Implement E2E Test Suite
```bash
# Already installed: @playwright/test
# Need to create:
- e2e-tests/highlight-basic.spec.js
- e2e-tests/highlight-persistence.spec.js
- e2e-tests/highlight-edge-cases.spec.js
```

Focus on tests that would have caught our bugs:
- Text with special characters (colon bug)
- Cross-element selections (list bug)
- Dynamic content handling
- Real website testing (GitHub, Wikipedia)

### 2. Features to Implement
- [ ] Export highlights (JSON, Markdown, PDF)
- [ ] Search within highlights
- [ ] Sync across devices (Chrome sync API)
- [ ] Keyboard shortcuts customization
- [ ] Notes attached to highlights
- [ ] Categories/tags for organization

### 3. Performance Optimizations
- [ ] Lazy load highlights for pages with many highlights
- [ ] Debounce storage operations
- [ ] Virtual scrolling for highlights list in popup

### 4. Bug Fixes & Improvements
- [ ] Handle dynamic content better (SPAs, AJAX)
- [ ] Improve highlight restoration accuracy
- [ ] Better handling of CSS conflicts on certain sites
- [ ] Add undo/redo functionality

### 5. Code Quality
- [ ] Add TypeScript for better type safety
- [ ] Implement proper error boundaries
- [ ] Add performance monitoring
- [ ] Create developer documentation

## Known Issues
1. Highlights may not work on some dynamic sites (need MutationObserver improvements)
2. Color picker position can be off-screen on page edges
3. No feedback when highlight fails (need user notifications)

## Development Commands
```bash
npm run dev          # Start development with HMR
npm run build        # Build for production
npm run preview      # Preview production build
npx playwright test  # Run E2E tests
```

## Key Lessons Learned
1. **Test with real browsers** - Unit tests miss browser-specific behaviors
2. **Keep architecture simple** - Redux-only is cleaner than mixed patterns
3. **Handle edge cases early** - Special characters and cross-element selections are common
4. **DOM is unpredictable** - Text nodes can be split anywhere by the browser

## Next Session Focus
1. Set up Playwright E2E test suite
2. Test on real websites (GitHub, Stack Overflow, Wikipedia)
3. Implement export functionality
4. Add proper error handling and user feedback

## Questions for Next Time
1. Should we add cloud sync or keep it local-only?
2. Premium features vs free? (Export, sync, unlimited highlights)
3. Target specific use cases? (Research, studying, code review)
4. Browser support - Edge, Firefox ports?
