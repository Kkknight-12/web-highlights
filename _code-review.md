1. Entry Points

- ✅ content/index.js - Main content script with proper initialization and cleanup
- ✅ background/index.js - Service worker with safe Chrome API usage
- ✅ popup/index.html - Basic HTML (no functionality implemented)

2. Core Highlighting Logic

- ✅ highlight-engine.js - Complete implementation with sanitization
- ✅ dom-highlighter.js - DOM batching properly implemented
- ✅ text-finder.js - O(n) algorithm with caching
- ✅ highlight-restorer.js - Batch restoration implemented
- ✅ highlight-constants.js - All constants defined

3. UI Components

- ✅ highlight-button.js - Complete with 50ms timeout fix
- ✅ mini-toolbar.js - Safe clipboard operations
- ✅ color-picker.js - Color management implemented

4. UI Templates

- ✅ All templates use safe DOM construction (no innerHTML)
- ✅ Position calculators and visibility managers implemented
- ✅ Selection handler with proper validation

5. Redux Store

- ✅ store.js - Batched saves with dirty tracking
- ✅ highlightsSlice.js - Uses safe storage functions
- ✅ uiSlice.js - UI state management

6. Utilities

- ✅ chrome-api.js - Safe wrappers properly implemented
- ✅ dom-safety.js - Comprehensive DOM safety utilities
- ✅ text-sanitizer.js - XSS prevention implemented
- ✅ constants.js - Centralized constants
- ✅ component-utils.js - Base component with cleanup

Key Findings

1. All functions have complete implementations - No placeholders or missing code
2. Security measures are in place - Sanitization, CSP, safe DOM operations
3. Performance optimizations implemented - Batching, caching, efficient algorithms
4. Memory leak prevention - Proper cleanup in all components
5. Error handling throughout - Try-catch blocks and validation

Minor Issues

1. Popup has no functionality - Just static HTML
2. Long functions remain - Could be refactored but work correctly
3. No tests - Code appears solid but lacks test coverage
