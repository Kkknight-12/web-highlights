## üöÄ Remaining Tasks for FREE Version Launch

### 1. **Basic Notes Feature with Detail View** ‚≠ê HIGH PRIORITY
**Time Estimate**: 4-5 hours  
**Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETED

**Requirements**:
- [x] Implement detail view pattern in popup
- [x] Add back navigation from detail to list view
- [x] Show full highlight text in detail view
- [x] Add note textarea (500 char limit) with character counter
- [x] Display note preview in list view (first 50 chars)
- [x] Note indicator icon for highlights with notes
- [x] Save/edit notes functionality
- [x] Export notes with highlights
- [x] **BONUS: Notes in Mini Toolbar** - Added expandable note field

**Detail View Layout**:
- Back button header
- Full highlight text (not truncated)
- Note textarea with char counter
- Color picker row
- Action buttons (Copy, Delete)

**Technical Notes**:
- Update highlight data structure to include `note` field
- Add view state management for list/detail navigation
- Smooth transitions between views

### 1.1 **Mini Toolbar Notes Feature** ‚úÖ COMPLETED
**What Made Save/Cancel Buttons Work**:

**The Critical Fix**: Understanding event capture vs bubble phases in nested interactive elements.

**Problem**: 
- Highlight click handler used capture phase: `addEventListener('click', handler, true)`
- This meant it received events BEFORE the note field could stop them
- Timeline: mousedown ‚Üí highlight clicks ‚Üí toolbar moves ‚Üí click fires on empty space

**Solution - Three Protection Layers**:

1. **Mousedown Flag System** (The Key Fix):
   ```javascript
   // Detect mousedown on note field BEFORE click happens
   document.addEventListener('mousedown', (e) => {
     if (e.target.closest('.note-field-container')) {
       this._ignoreNextHighlightClick = true;
       setTimeout(() => this._ignoreNextHighlightClick = false, 100);
     }
   }, true);
   ```

2. **Direct Click Detection**:
   ```javascript
   // In highlight click handler
   if (e.target.closest('.note-field-container')) {
     return; // Ignore clicks on note field
   }
   ```

3. **Existing Note Field Check**:
   ```javascript
   // Prevent repositioning if note field already open
   const existingNoteField = document.querySelector('.note-field-container');
   if (existingNoteField && existingNoteField.getAttribute('data-highlight-id') === element.dataset.highlightId) {
     return;
   }
   ```

**Why It Works**:
- Mousedown fires BEFORE click
- We set a flag during mousedown
- Highlight click handler sees flag and ignores the click
- Toolbar doesn't move
- Click event successfully hits the button

**Key Insight**: The gap between mousedown and click is where UI problems happen. By intercepting at mousedown, we prevent the cascade of events that was breaking the buttons.

### 2. **Draggable UI Elements** üéØ HIGH PRIORITY
**Time Estimate**: 3-4 hours  
**Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETED (Simplified implementation)

**Requirements**:
- [x] Make highlight button draggable
- [x] Make mini toolbar draggable (kept with position saving)
- [x] Show drag handle on hover
- [x] Snap to viewport edges (boundary checking)
- [x] Smooth drag animation
- [x] Prevent dragging outside viewport

**Implementation Details**:
- Highlight button: Draggable but always starts at calculated position (no saving)
- Mini toolbar: Draggable with saved positions per domain
- Removed all delays and throttling for instant response
- Direct DOM updates for smooth dragging
- Uses position: fixed for viewport consistency

**Optimizations Applied**:
- No Redux state updates during drag
- Removed requestAnimationFrame and throttling
- Direct style updates for zero-lag dragging
- Simplified double-click (no action needed)

**Files Created**:

- `src/content/utils/position-storage.js` - Domain-based position storage

**Files Modified**:
- `src/store/uiSlice.js` - Added drag state and position management

- `src/content/features/mini-toolbar.js` - Made draggable
- `src/content/styles.css` - Added drag-related styles
- `src/content/index.js` - Handle async initialization
