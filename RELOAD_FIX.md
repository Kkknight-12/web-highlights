# Chrome Web Highlighter - Page Reload Fix

## Problem
Highlights were disappearing when the page was reloaded because:
1. The content script tried to load highlights immediately before DOM was ready
2. Extension context could be temporarily invalid during page transitions
3. No retry mechanism if initial highlight loading failed
4. No handling for dynamically loaded content

## Solution Implemented

### 1. **Delayed Initialization**
- Added 100ms delay before loading highlights to ensure DOM is ready
- Added window 'load' event listener as fallback (500ms delay)

### 2. **Duplicate Prevention**
- Added `highlightsLoaded` flag to prevent loading highlights multiple times
- Check if highlight already exists before applying

### 3. **MutationObserver for Dynamic Content**
- Monitors DOM changes and loads highlights when new content appears
- Debounced to prevent excessive reloading (500ms delay)
- Only triggers on significant content changes

### 4. **Improved Highlight Restoration**
- Primary method: XPath-based restoration (fast and accurate)
- Fallback method: Text search across entire document
- Better error handling with warnings instead of errors

### 5. **Multiple Load Strategies**
```javascript
// Strategy 1: Initial load with delay
setTimeout(() => { loadHighlights(); }, 100);

// Strategy 2: MutationObserver for dynamic content
observeDOMChanges();

// Strategy 3: Window load event as fallback
window.addEventListener('load', () => {
    if (!highlightsLoaded) {
        setTimeout(loadHighlights, 500);
    }
});
```

### 6. **Message Handling Improvements**
- Added 'reloadHighlights' action for manual refresh
- Added response to prevent console errors
- Better context menu highlight support

## Key Changes

### content.js
1. Added `highlightsLoaded` flag
2. Added `restoreHighlightByXPath()` and `restoreHighlightByTextSearch()` functions
3. Added `observeDOMChanges()` with MutationObserver
4. Multiple initialization strategies
5. Better timing with delays
6. Improved error handling

## Testing

1. Create highlights on a page
2. Reload the page - highlights should persist
3. Navigate away and back - highlights should restore
4. Test on pages with dynamic content (SPAs)
5. Check console - fewer errors about DOM/context issues

## How It Works

1. **Page Load**: Content script initializes with delay
2. **DOM Ready**: Attempts to load highlights from storage
3. **Restore Process**: 
   - First tries XPath (original position)
   - Falls back to text search if needed
4. **Dynamic Content**: MutationObserver watches for changes
5. **Deduplication**: Checks prevent duplicate highlights

## Benefits

- Highlights persist across page reloads
- Works with dynamic/SPA websites
- Fewer console errors
- More reliable restoration
- Better performance with debouncing
