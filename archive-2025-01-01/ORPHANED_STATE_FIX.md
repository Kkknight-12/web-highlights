# Chrome Web Highlighter - Orphaned State Fix

## Problem
The highlight button stopped appearing after any "Extension context invalidated" error occurred. The extension would become permanently disabled on the page.

## Root Cause
The `isOrphaned` flag was being too aggressive:

1. Any context error sets `isOrphaned = true`
2. UI functions check `if (isOrphaned) return;`
3. Once orphaned, the extension never recovers
4. Even if the page is still valid, no UI elements would show

## Solution
Removed `isOrphaned` checks from UI display functions. The UI should still try to work even if Chrome APIs might fail.

### Functions Fixed:
- `showHighlightButton()` - Removed isOrphaned check
- `hideHighlightButton()` - Removed isOrphaned check  
- `showMiniToolbar()` - Removed isOrphaned check
- `hideMiniToolbar()` - Removed isOrphaned check

### Key Principle:
- Use `isOrphaned` only for Chrome API calls (storage, runtime, etc.)
- Don't use it for DOM operations (showing/hiding UI)
- Let UI operations fail gracefully with try-catch

## Code Pattern:
```javascript
// Good - Chrome API check
async function saveHighlight(highlight) {
    if (isOrphaned || !isExtensionContextValid()) {
        return;  // Don't call Chrome APIs
    }
    // ... chrome.storage calls
}

// Good - UI operation without orphaned check
function showHighlightButton(rect) {
    if (!highlightButtonContainer) return;  // Only check existence
    
    try {
        // DOM operations
    } catch (error) {
        // Handle errors gracefully
    }
}
```

## Result
The highlight button now appears even after context errors. The UI remains functional while Chrome API calls are safely blocked.
