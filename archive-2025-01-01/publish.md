You're right to proceed with publishing despite those yellow line indicators. Since the extension is working properly and those errors aren't affecting
functionality, you can publish it.

Next Steps:

1. Generate Icons:
   - Open generate-icons.html in your browser
   - Download all 3 icons
   - Save them in the assets/ folder
2. Prepare for Upload:
   ./prepare-for-store.sh
2. This will create a clean web-highlighter.zip file
3. Take Screenshots:
   - Screenshot 1: Show the extension highlighting text
   - Screenshot 2: Show the popup with saved highlights
4. Create Developer Account:
   - Go to https://chrome.google.com/webstore/devconsole
   - Pay the $5 one-time fee
5. Upload and Publish:
   - Upload the ZIP file
   - Use the content from PUBLISH_CHECKLIST.md for the store listing
   - Submit for review
